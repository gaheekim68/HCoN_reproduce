We added the `load_custom_data()` function to `utils.py` to load the dataset used in our experiments.
To verify that the dataset is loaded correctly, we ran a simple MLP model using `run_mlp.py`.
You can run the code using the `bash command.sh` script.
The dataset is also included in the compressed file.
